# SCAutoGrats
Configurable Auto Grats! and Guild Welcome! by The Shadow Collective

SC Auto Grats! is configurable to send up to 3 different Grats! and Welcome! messages. You can configure the addon to automatically send a congratulatory message to anyone in your general vicinity in say, members of your group in party, or members of your guild when an achievement is earned.

This addon will also welcome new members on joining your guild with 3 configurable welcome messages.

I've also provided a way to set a delay on sending messages between 1 and 10 seconds so that you are not immediately sending a message everytime an achievement pops.
This addon was originally designed to only welcome new guild members, but my guildies wanted an auto grats as well, so this is what they got.
